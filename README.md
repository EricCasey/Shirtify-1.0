A Project by @AdamRysyk & @EricCasey for Lighthouse Labs (Submitted Nov 2017)

Shirtvivor is a t-shirt store concept where anyone can submit a design to be voted on by the public. Each week, the design with the most votes is added to the store, and the design with the least sales is removed from the store. Stay on the island long enough and you might receive a reward.
